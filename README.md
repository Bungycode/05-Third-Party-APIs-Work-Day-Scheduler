# 05-Third-Party-Apis-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description 

The purpose of this program is to simulate the functionality of a work day scheduler. To the left is the different hours of the day defined by Am and Pm. In the middle is a text box that one could use to type in a certain activity during that time slot. To the right is a save box used to save your activity for the specified timeslot. The times, text boxes, and icons are dynamically generated. Moment.js was also used in this program.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a demonstration of what the finished web application's presentation and functionality will include:
